Sin embargo, debido al uso de un tokenizador por caracteres, ambas salidas carecen de coherencia lingüística y sentido semántico, por lo que las diferencias *se* aprecian más en términos de variación de patrones que en calidad textual."

    "# Conclusiones\n",
    "\n",
    "El trabajo permitió analizar el comportamiento de diferentes estrategias de decodificación —muestreo aleatorio puro, greedy, muestreo con temperatura, top-k y top-p— aplicadas a un modelo base (TinyGPT) y a una versión mejorada con arquitectura Mixture of Experts (MoE).\n",
    "\n",
    "Los resultados muestran que:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Las técnicas de decodificación afectan de manera directa el equilibrio entre diversidad y coherencia de las secuencias generadas. El muestreo aleatorio y temperaturas altas aportan mayor variabilidad, pero sacrifican sentido; greedy y temperaturas bajas generan salidas más predecibles, pero con riesgo de repeticiones; top-k y top-p logran un balance intermedio, aunque no eliminan por completo la incoherencia.\n",
    "\n",
    "* La tokenización por caracteres impone una limitación importante en la calidad lingüística: ninguna estrategia consigue producir frases gramaticalmente correctas de forma consistente.\n",
    "\n",
    "* La comparación entre TinyGPT y MoE evidencia que el uso de expertos introduce mayor diversidad en la generación incluso con métodos deterministas como greedy. Mientras TinyGPT tiende a estancarse en patrones repetitivos, el MoE incorpora variaciones que sugieren una explotación diferenciada del conocimiento de cada experto.\n",
    "\n",
    "* El MoE, aun con las limitaciones de tokenización, muestra un potencial claro para enriquecer las predicciones y evitar ciclos de repetición extrema, lo que podría traducirse en mejoras más notorias con una mejor tokenización.\n"
